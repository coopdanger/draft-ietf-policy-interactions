1.  Introduction

   This document captures a list of interactions between IETF standards-
   related efforts and external policy efforts (e.g., regulation or
   legislation) around the world, past or present.  The objective of
   this document is merely to catalogue these interactions in a single
   location.

   Comments and additional suggestions of policy interactions not listed
   here should be submitted via the issue tracker at
   https://github.com/coopdanger/draft-ietf-policy-interactions
   (https://github.com/coopdanger/draft-ietf-policy-interactions).

2.  Policy Interactions

2.1.  Encryption and Access to Communications

   THE IETF has a history of publishing documents that respond to policy
   developments surrounding the use of encryption, and more generally
   regarding access to communications.

   [RFC1984] stated the IESG and IAB's position regarding legal
   constraints on encryption in 1996, with a focus on the effects on the
   Internet.  The publication of the document was prompted in part by
   the controversy surrounding the US government's promotion of the
   Clipper Chip.  The document was elevated to Best Current Practice
   (which requires IETF-wide consensus) in 2015.

   [RFC2804] articulates why the IESG and IAB believed that it was not
   appropriate to accommodate wiretapping requirements from law
   enforcement, circa 2000.

   [RFC3365] set a requirement for IETF standard protocols to use
   'appropriate strong security mechanisms', including encryption.  It
   was published as Best Current Practice in 2002.

   [RFC7258] documents IETF consensus that pervasive monitoring is an
   attack, and thus should be mitigated in IETF protocols (often, using
   encryption).  It was a response to the Snowden revelations, and
   followed the Workshop on Strengthening the Internet Against Pervasive
   Monitoring (STRINT) https://www.w3.org/2014/strint/
   (https://www.w3.org/2014/strint/), held jointly by the W3C and IAB.
   Follow-on work to implement [RFC7258] includes opportunistic
   encryption [RFC7435] [RFC8110] [RFC8164], data minimization [RFC7816]
   [RFC9156], improvements to the encryption ecosystem such as [ACME],
   and discussion of mandatory encryption in [HTTP2], [TLS13], and
   [QUIC].

2.2.  DNS-over-HTTPS (DOH)

   [DOH] was a technical response to pervasive monitoring attacks on
   DNS.

   Some related news reporting: * Proposal to regulate in Russia
   (https://www.zdnet.com/article/russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-
   protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-doh-dot-esni/) * GCHQ sends 'warning' to
   Google and Mozilla over DoH
   (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/31/gchq-warns-google-
   mozilla-plans-encrypted-browsers/) * Congressional scrutiny of DoH
   (https://hub.packtpub.com/googles-dns-over-https-encryption-plan-
   faces-scrutiny-from-isps-and-the-congress/)

2.3.  TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)

   [ECH] is a work-in-progress effort to respond to pervasive monitoring
   attacks on TLS SNI, which exposes the hostname =being connected to,
   even when several hostnames are served by the same IP address.

   Some related news reporting: * Proposal to regulate in Russia
   (https://www.zdnet.com/article/russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-
   protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-doh-dot-esni/) * ESNI blocked in China
   (https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-is-now-blocking-all-encrypted-
   https-traffic-using-tls-1-3-and-esni/)

2.4.  Voice over IP

   The development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in the early
   2000s had involvement from regulators and their proxies.  There is a
   very significant amount of PSTN interop built into SIP.  See
   [RFC3261] and the rest of the SIP document suite.

2.5.  Emergency services

   The Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies (ECRIT)
   working group, which began in the starting mid-2000s, had extensive
   involvement from people working for/with Public Safety Answering
   Points (PSAPs) as well as some input from telecom regulators such as
   the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  See [RFC5222] and
   the rest of the document suite.

2.6.  Caller identity authentication

   Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) and the related SHAKEN
   initiative are designed to combat caller ID spoofing that uses VoIP.

   See [RFC8224], [RFC8225], [RFC8226], and [RFC8588].

   Regulatory mandates to use STIR exist in the US, Canada, and France
   thus far.

2.7.  Messaging interoperability

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group is
   chartered to work on interoperability for encrypted messaging.  This
   work was instigated based on requirements in the EU Digital Markets
   Act (DMA).  Several of the key participants have met with European
   Commission (EC) staff and participated in an EC workshop on the
   topic.  The area director and co-chairs are staying in touch with the
   EC staff focused on messaging interoperability.

2.8.  TV whitespaces database protocol

   The Protocol to Access Whitespaces (PAWS) working group was created
   based on requirements received from the FCC after they allocated TV
   whitespaces spectrum for unlicensed use.

2.9.  Broadband measurement

   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
   group was created as a result of disparate efforts by Ofcom in the
   UK, the FCC, and the Body of European Regulators of Electronic
   Communications (BEREC), who were all running their own jurisdiction-
   specific broadband speed measurement efforts (several of them using a
   vendor which had its own proprietary measurement protocol).  There
   were regulator participants involved in the protocol development
   effort.

2.10.  Incident response

   There has been long-term involvement (including people in area
   director roles) from those involved with various CERTs and national
   cybersecurity authorities in several of the IETF's working groups
   focused on incident response and exchange of incident/vulnerability
   information: Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE), Security
   Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM), and DDoS Open Threat
   Signaling (DOTS).

2.11.  P2P congestion control

   In 2008, the IETF hosted a workshop that was spurred by an FCC action
   regarding P2P traffic throttling.  See [RFC5594].  Related challenges
   associated with multiplexing flows with different characteristics
   were addressed in the Active Queue Management working group (see,
   e.g., [RFC7567]) and in the Congestion Exposure working group (see,
   e.g., [RFC7713]).

2.12.  Internet Architecture Board (IAB)

   In addition to the IAB's coordination with the Internet Society on
   policy matters, the IAB also frequently contributes to policy and
   regulatory proceedings around the world.  Some recent examples:

   *  2022: FTC commercial surveillance proceeding, European Commission
      eIDAS comments

   *  2018: NTIA comments on national privacy priorities, comments on
      Australian exceptional access bill

   IAB workshops also frequently include regulatory or policy
   perspectives, for example, the unwanted traffic workshop and the
   CARIS workshop.

3.  Security Considerations

   A number of the policy interactions above relate to security,
   encryption, and law enforcement access.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
