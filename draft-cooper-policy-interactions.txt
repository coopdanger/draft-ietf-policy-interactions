1.  Introduction

   This document captures a list of interactions between IETF efforts
   and policy efforts (e.g., regulation or legislation) around the
   world, past or present, successful or not.  The objective of this
   docment is merely to catalogue these interactions in a single
   location.

   Comments and additional suggestions of policy interactions not listed
   here should be submitted via the issue tracker at
   https://github.com/coopdanger/draft-ietf-policy-interactions
   (https://github.com/coopdanger/draft-ietf-policy-interactions).

2.  Policy Interactions

2.1.  STIR/SHAKEN

   Combatting caller ID spoofing using VoIP.

   RFCs 8224-6, 8588.

   *  FCC-mandated, expanded to Canada.

2.2.  MIMI

   Interoperability for encrypted messaging.

   *  Instigated by requirements in the EU DMA.  Several of the key
      participants have met with EC staff and participated in the EC
      workshop on the topic.  The AD and co-chairs are staying in touch
      with the EC staff focused on messaging interop.

2.3.  DoH

   DNS-over-HTTPS.

   RFC8484 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8484.html).

   *  Proposal to regulate in Russia (https://www.zdnet.com/article/
      russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-
      doh-dot-esni/)

   *  GCHQ sends 'warning' to Google and Mozilla over DoH
      (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/31/gchq-warns-google-
      mozilla-plans-encrypted-browsers/)

   *  Congressional scrutiny of DoH (https://hub.packtpub.com/googles-
      dns-over-https-encryption-plan-faces-scrutiny-from-isps-and-the-
      congress/)

2.4.  ECH

   TLS Encrypted Client Hello.

   Ongoing draft in the TLS WG (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-
   ietf-tls-esni/).

   *  Proposal to regulate in Russia (https://www.zdnet.com/article/
      russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-
      doh-dot-esni/)

   *  ESNI blocked in China (https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-is-now-
      blocking-all-encrypted-https-traffic-using-tls-1-3-and-esni/);
      ECH?

2.5.  Encryption BCPs

   *  RFC 1984 and all the discussions that led up to it

   *  RFC 2804 and all the discussions that led up to it

   *  RFC 3365

   *  RFC 7258 and all the post-Snowden follow-on activity related to
      encryption; data minimization in DNS, DHCP, and elsewhere;
      opportunistic encryption (however impotent that proved to be);
      ACME; HTTP/2 discussions, TLS 1.3, and QUIC --> I think all of
      these efforts trace some roots back to post-Snowden.

2.6.  VoIP

   Early years of SIP (early 2000s) had involvement from regulators and
   their proxies -- obviously there is a ton of PSTN interop built into
   SIP.  RFC 3261 and the rest of the document suite. .

2.7.  Emergency services

   ECRIT (starting mid-2000s) had extensive involvement from people
   working for/with Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) as well as
   some input from telecom regulators like the FCC.  RFC 5222 and the
   rest of the document suite.

2.8.  TV whitespaces database protocol

   PAWS (2014-15) -- this whole WG was created based on requirements
   received from the FCC after they freed up the TV whitespaces spectrum
   for unlicensed use.

2.9.  Broadband measurement

   LMAP (2013-2018) -- WG was created as a result of disparate efforts
   by Ofcom, FCC, and BEREC who were all running their own jurisdiction-
   specific broadband speed measurement efforts (several of them using
   SamKnows which had its own proprietary measurement protocol).  There
   were a few regulator people who stayed involved in the protocol
   development effort, although the protocol itself did not get used
   much.

2.10.  Incident response

   There has been long-term involvement (including people in AD roles)
   from those involved with various CERTs and national cybersecurity
   authorities in several of the IETF's working groups focused on
   incident response and exchange of incident/vulnerability information:
   MILE, SACM, DOTS.

2.11.  P2P congestion control

   In 2008, the IETF hosted an entire workshop that was spurred by an
   FCC action against Comcast regarding P2P traffic throttling.  See RFC
   5594.

2.12.  IAB

   In addition to the IAB's coordination with ISOC on policy matters,
   the IAB also frequently contributes to policy and regulatory
   proceedings around the world.  Some recent examples:

   *  2022: FTC commercial surveillance proceeding, EC eIDAS comments

   *  2018: NTIA comments on national privacy priorities, comments on
      Australian exceptional access bill

   IAB workshops also frequently include regulatory or policy
   perspectives.  E.g., the unwanted traffic workshop, the CARIS
   workshop

3.  Security Considerations

   A number of the policy interactions above relate to security,
   encryption, and law enforcement access.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
